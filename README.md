### Not sure what to do?

It's hard to get started when you're not sure about what to do, so here are some suggestions:

- Try adding a file with your username in the title. For example, my username is **muan**, so I'd create a file named `muan.html`, like [this](https://github.com/muan/hello-world/commit/a25ce6ab6d71fa3e7311e90538eee3f797b29aec). It can be any type of files you want, may it be `muan.md`, `muan.txt`, or just `muan`.

- Add your username to `human.txt`.

- (:+1: Bonus) Sort the `human.txt`, so the file is in an alphabetical order.

- (:+1: Bonus) Add some fun content to your own file. Check out mine: http://muan.co/hello-world/muan.html
