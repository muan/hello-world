Well... I don't really know how to use github because I use it integrated on the Android Studio. So I only have to click on
Commit or Pull. I am developing an app called Teewa. It is developed by a whole team that works right inside my university!
So I go to class in the morning, then I have lunch, then I lay down on the floor a bit and then I go to work. I usually
go home very late by bus. It is very dangerous, but I have no choice. 

Now me and the guy that works with me in the App Team are learning to develop with React Native. I've never used JS, but it has
been really cool. It is a pretty cool programming language.

I forgot to tell you that I am graduating on Computer Science. I'm right in the middle of the course: it is a 4 year course 
and I have already completed 2 years B) 

Anyway.
No one will read this but I'm satisfied with it.
Na verdade eu falo português, porque eu sou do Brasil, mas acho que inglês é melhor pra essas coisas, né?

Beijos e abraços
Giulia
