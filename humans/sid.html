		<h1>Hello Guys!</h1>
			<p>
			What can I say I'm still learning to code, I decided to learn it a year ago
			as I was really interested in it and the job prospects. Ultimate goal would be to,
			become a front-end web developer but also a game developer as well.
			</p>
			<p>
			My Main Interests are:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Playing Sports</li>
					<li>Coding</li>
					<li>Playing Games</li>
					<li>Watching Anime</li>
					<li>Eating Food</li>
				</ul>
			<p>
			Always willing to learn so feel free to message me on my <a href="https://github.com/thatSOkid97">Github</a> account.
